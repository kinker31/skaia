# Skaia

Skaia is a fork of Crispy, which serves to do the following:

1. Completely overhaul the mapping format from the ground up.
2. Implement experimental gameplay features.
3. Don't bork Crispy Doom too hard doing so.

Right now, this fork is an EXTREME work in progress, and it's probably gonna be a while before it properly builds.

# Releases and Compiling

The process shouldn't be too different from the parent branch, unless specified otherwise down below.
